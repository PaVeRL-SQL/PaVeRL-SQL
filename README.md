## PaVeRL-SQL

**PaVeRL-SQL** is the repository for paper "PaVeRL-SQL: Text–to–SQL via Partial–Match
Rewards and Verbal Reinforcement Learning"

#### Environment
Generally the pipeline works with pytorch>=2.6.0, transformers>=4.48.2, and vllm>=0.8.2, if newer backbone model is needed, the corresponding packages need to satisfy the model requirement as well. For verl installation, we follow the verl documents as following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/volcengine/verl && cd verl
pip install -e .
```
